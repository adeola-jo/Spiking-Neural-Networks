# Spiking-Neural-Networks
A repository of spiking neural networks learning material



# Several open-source datasets well-suited for SNN projects:

### Traditional Vision Datasets (need encoding to spikes)
1. **MNIST** - Handwritten digits (beginner-friendly)
2. **Fashion-MNIST** - Clothing items (slightly more challenging than MNIST)
3. **CIFAR-10/100** - Small natural images in multiple categories
4. **N-MNIST** - Neuromorphic version of MNIST recorded with event-based cameras

### Neuromorphic/Event-Based Datasets (native spike data)
1. **DVS128 Gesture** - Hand gestures recorded with DVS cameras
2. **N-Caltech101** - Event-based version of the Caltech101 dataset
3. **DAVIS Driving Dataset** - Automotive scenes recorded with event cameras
4. **IBM DVS Falls** - Human fall detection recordings
5. **ASL-DVS** - American Sign Language gestures
6. **DvsGesture** - Various hand gestures

### Temporal/Time Series Datasets
1. **UCI HAR** - Human Activity Recognition
2. **Speech Commands** - Spoken word classification
3. **SHD** - Spiking Heidelberg Digits (speech)
4. **Spiking Speech Command (SSC)** - Preprocessed audio as spike trains

### Neuromorphic Benchmarks
1. **Heidelberg Spiking Datasets** - Benchmarks specifically for SNNs
2. **SnnTorch Tutorials Datasets** - Example datasets in the SnnTorch library
